Mileage Prediction â€“ Regression Analysis
This project predicts vehicle mileage (MPG) using regression techniques on the Auto MPG dataset from Carnegie Mellonâ€™s StatLib library. It applies Linear and Polynomial Regression to analyze the impact of factors like cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year. The goal is to build accurate models for fuel efficiency prediction, providing insights for automotive engineers, manufacturers, and consumers. The project uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, visualization, training, and evaluation.

Key Features:

ðŸ“Š Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis

ðŸ”‘ Feature scaling using StandardScaler

ðŸ¤– Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models

âœ… Performance evaluation with MAE, MAPE, and RÂ²

ðŸš— Insights into key factors influencing vehicle mileage
